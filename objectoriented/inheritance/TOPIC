1.Inheritances,Type of inheritance,Benefits
2.scalibility ,reusability


In java, we can achive inheritance by using keyword "extends"
 Modification of superclass will automatically affect all subclass

' relationship.
class parent is inherited by class child
all child class instances are also  parent class
not all parent class instances are child class 


' Benefits
promote code reusability , scalability
common propertis and functionality can written in one class(parent) 
other class inherit the common class(parent) and add on unique functionality


' Type of inheritance
1.single-level: one super class , one sub class 
 Syntax: class Subclass extends Superclass.

2.hierarchical: one super class , many sub class
class Subclass1 extends Superclass and class Subclass2 extends Superclass.

3.multi-level :a class which is inherit from one class and also parent for another class
 Syntax: class Subclass1 extends Superclass and class Subclass2 extends Subclass1.

'below  two inheritance is not supported by java (class can only have one super class )
' because it cause unnecessary complexity and are rarely required
4.multiple : one sub class  inherit  behaviour of two super class
5.hybrid: one sub class  inherit  behaviour of two super class and also that two super class being act like  a child for one new  parent class



' inheritance not only make a program secure but also make a  more easier
